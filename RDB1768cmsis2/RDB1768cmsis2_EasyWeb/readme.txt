EasyWeb example for Code Red RDB1768 Development Board
======================================================

[ Note that this project requires the CMSISv2p00_LPC17xx and RDB1768 LCD
  library projects to exist in the same workspace. ]
  
The EasyWeb application was originally written by Andreas Dannenberg
of HTWK Leipzig, University of Applied Sciences, Germany, running on
a Texas Instruments MPS430 microcontroller. The application provides
a simple embedded TCP stack and webserver

Code Red have adapted this software to run on the Code Red RDB1768
Development Board. The project uses the LCD screen to display 
messages during stack initialisation, including the configured
IP address that the board will use.

Support

This example project is based on an open source original.
Code Red can provide support on using this project as supplied to 
users with a valid support contract with us. But if you require 
assistance on the general use of the software or on extending the 
example, then we would recommend that you raise your questions
to an appropriate community forum, such as....

Using the example
-----------------

In order to use this example:

1) Modify the network configuration settings in the file tcpip.h 
   to match your actual physical network (changing the IP address
   in MYIP_* appropriately). As supplied the IP address is set
   to 192.168.0.200.
   
   You may also need to change the MAC address in ethmac.h - its
   value must be not be the same as that of any other network card
   connected to your network. As supplied the MAC address is set
   to 01-02-03-04-05-06.
   
   Also ensure that the board is physically connected to your 
   network via an ethernet cable.

2) Build the application project within the IDE. Turn on the 
   board and ensure it is connected to your host PC with the 
   appropriate cables. Then select debug within Red Suite to 
   download the application to the board. After download has 
   occured, click on the "resume" icon to begin execution.

3) Once the application is executing, start a web browser on 
   your PC, and enter the network address you configured in 
   tcpip.h (for example 192.168.0.200). The web page being 
   served from the board should then appear in your browser 
   window.


The web page shows two dynamic values generated by the 
application itself (though the current port does not generate
these from IO ports as the original version did).

Note that due to its simple nature, easyweb has some 
restrictions, including:
- Only one active TCP session is supported at any one time
- There is no support for fragmented IP datagrams
- There is no buffer for TCP datagrams received in wrong order
- Only one pre-built web page is served, though the contents 
  of this are updated dynamically. Also the use of GIF/JPG
  graphic files within the webpage is not possible.
  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note that this example project is intended for use with Red Suite /
LPCXpresso IDE v4.0 or later.

Use of this project with earlier versions of the Code Red IDE is 
not recommended or supported.
