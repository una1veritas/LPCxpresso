The uIP TCP/IP stack is an extremely small implementation 
of the TCP/IP protocol suite intended for embedded systems 
running low-end 8 or 16-bit microcontrollers. The code size 
and RAM requirements of uIP is an order of magnitude smaller 
than other generic TCP/IP stacks today. It can only handle a 
single network interface and contains the IP, ICMP, UDP and 
TCP protocols.

The uip_webserver implements WEB server.

The default IP address is:
192.168.0.100

The uip_webserver program is available in 2 targets: 
  MCB1700 IRAM 	: 	runs from Internal SRAM on Keil MCB1700 board
  MCB1700 FLASH	: 	runs from Internal Flash on Keil MCB1700 board
